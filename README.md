# The State of South Africa's Birds 2022

This project aims to analyse population trends for South Africa's birds over the last 15 years. The South African bird indicators are measures of the reporting rates of bird populations and provide a proxy for the overall trends in biodiversity across both the whole of South Africa and its different major habitat types.

This is a collaboration between researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand and University of Cape Town.
